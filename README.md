## Overview

In todayâ€™s world with so many cars and models in the market, it is hard to find an authentic source for the maintenance cost/index of cars. We are developing a system that shows the health and maintenance index of various car models or car parts based on multiple factors.

## Objectives

- Collect data from authentic sources regarding the maintenance of different car models.
- Calculate the maintenance cost of vehicles based on factors such as aging, usage patterns, and mileage.
- Compare the maintenance index of various vehicles to help consumers, car manufacturers, and government agencies make informed decisions.
- Provide insights into the probability of specific components needing replacement.

## Benefits

1. **Consumers:** Enables decision-making when buying a car based on the maintenance index. Customers can select car models according to usage patterns in different regions, taking into account the aging of the vehicle and mileage.
2. **Car Manufacturers:** With the available data, OEMs can design more robust parts, reducing warranty and service costs. Companies can analyze their models' performance compared to competitors in a particular region.
3. **Government:** Helps in drafting policies and approvals for new model launches in the market.
4. **Second-hand Car Buyers:** Assists customers in choosing the most suitable cars available for sale based on maintenance data.

## Uniqueness

1. **Based on 3 C's: Collect, Calculate, and Compare:** Collects data from authentic sources, calculates the maintenance cost based on certain factors, and then compares it with other vehicles.
2. **City-wise Comparison:** Compares maintenance data across different cities.
3. **Time-saving:** Saves users time by providing consolidated information on a single platform.
4. **Component Probability:** Shows the probability of specific components needing replacement.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Storage:** SQLite
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git
